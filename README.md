# Hiking

This is a 2 days exercise based on learning PHP.
The aim is to add, display, modify and delete hikes.

I used this website to display some real informations : https://randopitons.re/randonnees/top5

Those were the requirements :
- Use PDO's prepare and execute methods.
- Inform visitors when a hike is added or modified.
- Use sanitization on database inputs and outputs.

## Technology use

PHP, JavaScript, MySQL
